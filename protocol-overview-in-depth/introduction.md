# Introduction

StakeWise is a DeFi protocol that offers a simple and safe way to stake ETH on favourable terms and to farm, restake, and borrow with your stake for more yield using osETH, a liquid staking token.&#x20;

StakeWise pioneers the concept of a staking marketplace that allows stakers to choose their own node operators, earn more staking profits, minimize slashing risk, and stake solo, all while keeping their stake liquid.&#x20;

StakeWise also provides individuals, communities and businesses with the tools to launch their own staking pools from scratch and give their users osETH, a liquid staking token with an extensive liquidity & utility ecosystem developed by the StakeWise DAO.&#x20;

StakeWise is a good fit for you if you are:

* An everyday staker who wants a simple and secure solution for staking your capital, with the potential to use your staked capital in DeFi apps.
* A solo staker who wants to mint a liquid staking token against your own node, and also has the potential to offer fully trustless, non-custodial staking as a service to others.
* A whale/fund/DAO/institution looking for a bespoke staking solution to best suit your needs, whilst being able to access DeFi with staked capital.&#x20;

osETH is the main liquid staking token for the StakeWise ecosystem. With in-built slashing protection and yield accrual from a highly diversified set of node operators, osETH is a simple and secure way to stake ETH while preserving access to DeFi.&#x20;

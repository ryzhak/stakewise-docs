<summary>How does StakeWise work?</summary>

The main components of the StakeWise protocol are Vaults, osETH token, Oracles, and NodeWise.&#x20;

### Vaults

Users stake ETH into different Vaults and earn ETH rewards, while Vault operators earn a staking fee in exchange. Anyone can launch their own Vault to allow others to stake in it.

### osETH

osETH is a token for liquid staking that accrues ETH rewards to its holders. It can be used in DeFi to trade staked ETH and farm additional rewards.&#x20;

osETH is minted by stakers in Vaults that want to use their stake in DeFi. Anyone can swap their ETH for osETH in DeFi to start earning ETH rewards by holding the token.&#x20;

### Oracles

Oracles ensure that Vaults register validators without assuming custody of funds, calculate Vault rewards, and push information about validator registrations and exits on-chain.&#x20;

### NodeWise

NodeWise is Ethereum node management software that simplifies Solo staking. It can be installed on any machine to run your own validators simply and securely.

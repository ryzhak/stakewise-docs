# DVT

The Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) represents a crucial element poised to revolutionize consensus scalability. Much like roll-up technology in Layer 2 scaling, DVT is set to significantly enhance scalability while upholding decentralization. As DVT continues to evolve, it is expected to become a fundamental building block, safeguarding the security and decentralization of public blockchain networks.

StakeWise Vaults stand out for their compatibility with both Obol and SSV DVT technologies, offering an additional layer of security and decentralization to the network. This interoperability greatly bolsters the long-term sustainability of public blockchain networks, empowering stakeholders with diverse options for securing and leveraging their assets.

# Change solo withdrawal credentials to 0x01 address

{% hint style="warning" %}
Partial and full withdrawals from staking require validators to have an execution layer address, known as the 0x01 withdrawal address. By default, validators created using StakeWise Solo have 0x00 withdrawal credentials, which must be changed to 0x01 withdrawal address to exit from staking or benefit from partial withdrawals. This guide will teach you how to change 0x00 withdrawal credentials to a 0x01 address.
{% endhint %}

We created a guide to walk you through the process of changing withdrawal credentials.&#x20;

To find the right guide for you, choose your operating system.

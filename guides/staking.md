Explore our how-to guides to start staking with StakeWise.&#x20;

### One-click staking

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ETH" %}
One-click staking relies on converting ETH for osETH, a liquid staking token of StakeWise. You will accrue ETH staking rewards by holding osETH in a wallet or in a smart contract.&#x20;

osETH can be converted back into ETH at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.&#x20;

[<mark style="color:blue;">Read more about osETH -></mark>](../protocol-overview-in-depth/ostoken.md)

### How to stake ETH with one click

1. Head to the [<mark style="color:blue;">Stake</mark>](https://app.stakewise.io) page in the StakeWise dApp and connect your wallet.
2. Enter the amount of ETH you would like to stake. The interface will show the amount of osETH tokens you will receive in return.&#x20;
3. Note that the conversion ratio between osETH and ETH is >1 because osETH continuously accumulates staking rewards.&#x20;
4. Press Deposit and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
5. Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you will receive osETH in your wallet and begin staking.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GNO" %}
One-click staking relies on converting GNO for osGNO, a liquid staking token of StakeWise on Gnosis Chain. You will accrue GNO staking rewards by holding osGNO in a wallet or in a smart contract.&#x20;

osGNO can be converted back into GNO at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.&#x20;

### How to stake GNO with one click

1. Head to the [<mark style="color:blue;">Stake</mark>](https://app.stakewise.io/?networkId=gnosis) page in the StakeWise dApp and connect your wallet.
2. Enter the amount of GNO you would like to stake. The interface will show the amount of osGNO tokens you will receive in return.&#x20;
3. Note that the conversion ratio between osGNO and GNO is >1 because osGNO continuously accumulates staking rewards.&#x20;
4. Press Deposit and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
5. Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you will receive osGNO in your wallet and begin staking.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Staking with Vaults

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ETH" %}
Staking with Vaults allows you to pick the specific terms on which your ETH will be staked, including the node operators that will run validators, relays used for MEV, and the staking fee.&#x20;

By staking in a particular Vault, you will earn ETH staking rewards only from that Vault's validators. You can unstake from a Vault at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.&#x20;

[<mark style="color:blue;">Read more about Vaults -></mark>](../protocol-overview-in-depth/vaults.md)

Your stake in any Vault can be made liquid by minting osETH, a liquid staking token.&#x20;

### How to stake with Vaults

1. Head to the [<mark style="color:blue;">Vault Marketplace</mark>](https://app.stakewise.io) page in the StakeWise dApp and connect your wallet.
2. Browse through the different Vaults using Performance, APY, and TVL as filters.
3. Once you choose a Vault, press on the Stake button in the Vault interface.
4. Enter the amount of ETH you would like to stake.
5. Press the Stake button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### How to make your stake in the Vault liquid

1. Head to the Vault page and connect your wallet.
2. Press the Mint button.
3. Enter the amount of osETH you want to mint or use the slider to choose the proportion of your stake that will be made liquid.&#x20;
4. Note that the maximum value of osETH you can mint is set to 90% of your stake in the Vault. The profitability of your stake in the Vault is not reduced to the proportion you choose and remains fully intact.&#x20;
5. Press the Mint button and confirm the transaction in your wallet.&#x20;
6. Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you will start liquid staking

Liquid solo staking works by creating a Vault with desired parameters (e.g. MEV smoothing) and staking your ETH in it, triggering the launch of solo validators on your node.&#x20;

By staking in your Vault, you will earn ETH staking rewards only from your solo validators. You can unstake from your Vault at any time to receive the deposit and accumulated rewards.
